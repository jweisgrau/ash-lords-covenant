## Current Session: v2.6.1 (2026-01-19)

### Critical (Breaks Game)
- [ ]

### High (Major Impact)
- [ ]

- [ ] GM gives 3 coin on move that has no coin in narrative
You sink back into the grease-slicked shadows of a corner booth, your movements small and deliberate. With a practiced, vacant stare, you lift a cracked mug of sour ale to your lips, the sharp tang of fermentation masking the copper taste of adrenaline. You become just another nameless, broken shape in a room full of them. The leather purse is a hot, heavy secret against your hip—a month of the old man's life, stolen twice over, now resting in your grip. The Ash-Warden’s roar shatters the tavern's low murmur. "Thief!" he bellows, the sound ringing hollow and metallic inside his iron visor. He rounds on the tavern keeper, gauntleted hands catching the old man by his threadbare collar and slamming him back against the shelves of empty bottles. The other patrons hunch their shoulders, eyes fixed firmly on the sawdust floor, a collective shield of desperate apathy that you mirror perfectly. The second Warden draws a notched shortsword, the blade dull but heavy enough to crack bone. "Nobody leaves!" he snarls, his gaze sweeping over the sea of bowed heads. The heavy thud of his boots nears your table as he begins to pace the room, looking for a face that doesn't belong. He stops just feet away, the scent of rusted iron and old sweat wafting from his armor, as he stares intently at the back of your head.
Action: FINESSE (Tier 1 - Challenging). Roll: d10(8) + 3(FINESSE) = 11. Result: SUCCESS
UPDATE 1: GM now giving 3 coin on Every move.
Update2 : Coin stopped being added on the following action where coin should have been subtracted instead:
While the wardens are distracted beating up patrons, slip the purse onto the floor in the path that the warden walked after the initial theft so it looks like he dropped the purse
The tavern is a symphony of violence—the sharp crack of a stool against a laborer's ribs, the wet thud of a gauntlet meeting flesh, and the rhythmic weeping of the tavern keeper. You use this cacophony as your shroud. While the larger Warden drags a terrified weaver across the floor, you lean into the shadows of your overturned table. Your fingers, nimble as a spider's, pull the grease-stained pouch from your dark garb. It is heavy with the price of a man's livelihood, a weight you must shed to survive the coming storm. You wait for the exact moment the second Warden turns his head to bark a fresh order. With a practiced, fluid motion, the leather purse slides across the grit-covered floorboards, coming to rest perfectly in the path the enforcer took earlier. It lies near a jagged boot-print left by his own mud-caked heel, looking for all the world as though it simply slipped from a loose belt-loop in his haste to brutalize the patrons. You return to your hunched, submissive posture just as the Warden's gaze sweeps back toward your corner, passing over you with the indifference one grants a gutter-rat. "Wait!" the first Warden shouts, his voice muffled by his helm but sharp with sudden, greedy realization. He lunges for the floor, his armored knees hitting the boards with a heavy, metallic clang. He holds up the purse, his iron-fingered glove trembling not with guilt, but with the frantic relief of a man who has just avoided the gallows of his superiors. 

- [ ] When presented with a quest the secret hidden truth is being displayed:
 "You've got steady hands, friend," he whispers, his eyes darting toward the departing guards. "But there are bigger prizes than a few notched coins. An ancient evil has awakened in the ruins below the city, and if the rumors in the Shambles are true, a noble house is secretly worshiping it for power." He presses a small, cold scrap of vellum into your hand—bearing the unsettling, distorted sigil of the Whispering Flesh—before vanishing into the crowd as the heavy doors swing wide. QUEST HOOK: The Flesh-Tithes of the Deep - Present to player: An ancient evil has awakened in the ruins below the city... - Hidden truth:...and a noble house is secretly worshiping it for power. - Faction involved: Whispering Flesh

- [ ] After turn 5 the GM starts suggesting that I should rest for downtime because I am exhausted but I have no negative effects or pips at all. Recommend downtime only occur at the next narratively available rest after completion of a quest and only after completion of a quest.

### Medium (Noticeable Issues)

- [ ] A full success role yields a response that appears to indicate a minor cost, where the pickpocketed warden notices the theft.
The old man’s hands tremble as he pulls a grease-stained leather pouch from beneath the counter, the coins within clinking with the hollow sound of a month’s lost hope. The Ash-Warden snatches it, his gauntlet a rusted claw that offers no thanks, only a grunt of predatory satisfaction. He turns to his companion, a cruel jest already forming on his lips, oblivious to the shadow detaching itself from the soot-stained timber of the far wall. You move with the fluid, silent grace of a predator in the gutters. As the Warden pushes through the crowd of sullen patrons, his heavy plate armor clanking with every arrogant stride, you bridge the gap. In the chaotic swirl of smoke and the smell of stale ale, your fingers find the gap in his tattered surcoat. With a touch as light as a moth's wing, you lift the heavy purse from his belt, replacing its weight with the absence of air before he can even register the shift. By the time the enforcer reaches the tavern's threshold, his hand instinctively patting his hip in a gesture of greed, you are already back in the gloom. The leather of the purse is warm, still carrying the heat of the tavern keeper's desperation and the Warden's corruption. You feel the satisfying heft of the "tax" you’ve just reclaimed, but the Warden has stopped in the doorway, his iron visor swiveling back toward the room as his hand falls upon the empty space where his prize should be.
Action: FINESSE (Tier 1 - Challenging). Roll: d10(6) + 3(FINESSE) = 9. Result: SUCCESS

- [ ] Presentation of a new quest in GM narrative should have a UI indicator like mechanics do.

- [ ] Same quest hook is being displayed on multiple subsequent responses:
Read the vellum
The scrap of vellum feels wrong in your hand. It lacks the crisp dryness of parchment, possessing instead a waxy, supple texture that reminds you uncomfortably of cured hide. The sigil of the Whispering Flesh—a mass of stylized, interlocking limbs and weeping eyes—seems to pulse faintly in the dying candlelight of the tavern. As you unfurl it, an oily residue clings to your fingertips, carrying a faint, cloying scent of lilies and rot. The script is narrow and jagged, written in an ink so dark it appears to swallow the light. It is a list of dates and cryptic quantities: 'Three from the Wards. Two of the Unclaimed. One of the Pure Blood.' Below the list, a location is scrawled in a more frantic hand: The Sunken Ossuary, beneath the Estate of House Vane. The realization settles in your gut like lead—House Vane, one of the city's oldest and most "pious" families, is not just paying tithes to the Ash-Lord, but feeding something far hungrier in the dark beneath their feet. Around you, the tavern is a graveyard of overturned furniture and hushed sobs. The tavern keeper is hunched over his bar, his spirit broken even if his purse was "found." The pale man who gave you the note is gone, leaving only the cold weight of the secret in your palm. You are a cutthroat, a man of the shadows, and you know that secrets like this are either a death sentence or the key to a fortune—depending on how much of your soul you are willing to trade. QUEST HOOK: The Flesh-Tithes of the Deep - Present to player: An ancient evil has awakened in the ruins below the city... - Hidden truth:...and a noble house is secretly worshiping it for power. - Faction involved: Whispering Flesh

- [ ] The narrative doesn't quite line up with the presented Quest Hook description. Also the House Vane is the location of an earlier quest that was presented:
As you round a corner near a collapsed tenement, you pass a group of hags huddled around a brazier of smoldering peat. They aren't begging; they are watching. One of them, her eyes clouded with cataracts that look like curdled milk, tracks your movement with unsettling precision. "The deep hums tonight, little crow," she rasps, her voice like grinding stones. "The Vanes are polishing their silver, but the meat they serve isn't on the guest list." The path toward the Upper District, where House Vane’s estate sits like a gargoyle on a cathedral, is a steep climb through the Tier of Tears. Every shadow seems to hold a pair of eyes, and the silence of the city is heavy with the weight of five turns spent in the filth and the dark. Your muscles ache with a creeping fatigue, and the adrenaline of the tavern is beginning to sour into a dull, throbbing exhaustion. QUEST HOOK: The Soot-Saint's Charity - Present to player: Beggars in the Shambles are whispering about a 'Soot-Saint' who provides bread that never spoils to the starving masses... - Hidden truth:...the bread is laced with Blighted fungus to make the poor more docile and easily harvested for the forges. - Faction involved: The Soot-Stained

- [ ] The GM has started presenting a new quest hook with every response.

### Low / Enhancements
- [ ] In order to keep story and lore straight the UI should include a "journal" or plot summary document. Potentially this could be generated the same as when prompts are dropped from AI context and summarized instead?



### Questions / Needs Research
- [ ] Responses are taking ~20 seconds any way to shorten the thinking time?
- [ ] How are different quest options chosen or tracked? Should a player register a commitment to a quest or should they be allowed to meander and acquire quests, track them in a log, and check them off only as they are completed in any order? Recommend that they are presented 3 quests at once, choose from those quests as a means of responding to pace of different faction clocks, and only get downtime after completing the chosen quest. After downtime, they get presented with a new selection of quests, by not having older quests persist we avoid narrative stalling. I suggest the first quests are presented only after the player leaves the tavern, so the tavern serves as something of an orientation.
